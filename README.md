# Positive_Pressure

This is a positive pressure system for maintaining a cleanroom, laminar flow box or similar.
The master unit senses pressure inside the space, and the slave unit senses pressure from 
outside the space, and sends that information wirelessly over Xbee.
The master unit uses the differential in pressure to control the control voltage
for an industrial climate control fan that is blowing filtered air into the space.
